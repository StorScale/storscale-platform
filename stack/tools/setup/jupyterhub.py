"""Configure the JupyterHub example's Buckets: buckets, policies, a dataset.

  - `home`: everyone's own files, under home/<their Keycloak username>/. One
    policy statement covers everyone, through the policy variable
    ${jwt:preferred_username}, so nobody can read anyone else's prefix.
  - `datasets`: shared data. Analysts read it; engineers read and write it.

The policies are named after the Keycloak groups people sign in with
(MINIO_IDENTITY_OPENID_CLAIM_NAME=groups), so a person's groups are their
permissions. There are no service accounts: notebooks reach Buckets as the
person who signed in. Safe to run again.
