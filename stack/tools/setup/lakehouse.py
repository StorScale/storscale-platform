"""Configure the platform's base: Buckets, then Ranger.

Buckets
  - buckets `warehouse` (Iceberg tables), `scratch` (people's own files) and
    `storscale-platform` (the platform's projects, and their status);
  - policy `lakehouse-engine` (the warehouse, read and write) for the engines'
    service accounts, `trino-svc` and `nessie-svc`; policy `platform-store` for
    platformd's account, `platform-svc`;
  - policies `analysts` and `engineers`, named after the Keycloak groups people
    sign in with: `scratch` only. Nobody but the engines can read the warehouse,
    so Ranger's masks and row filters can't be bypassed by reading the files.

Ranger
  - Keycloak's users and groups, copied over, and the pipelines' service
    account in group pipelines (Keycloak doesn't list service accounts among
    its users, so Ranger's usersync would need the same);
  - the Trino service `lakehouse`, and the policies below: who may run
    queries and see the catalog. A project's tables, and who may use them,
    are the project's: the platform operator adds and removes those policies.

Safe to run again: everything is created or updated in place.
