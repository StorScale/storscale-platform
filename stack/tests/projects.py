"""Projects, end to end: docker compose run --rm test projects

A project is a team's tables, files and pipelines, and who may use them. An
administrator (bob, an engineer) creates, changes and deletes projects in
the platform; the platform operator applies them to Keycloak, Ranger,
Buckets and Nessie. These check that what a project says is what people get:

  1. the sales project (projects/sales.json, made at setup) is ready, with
     its members: alice reads, bob edits, the pipelines' service account runs;
  2. only administrators change projects; people see the projects they're
     in; a spec with mistakes is refused, saying what's wrong;
  3. a new project, marketing, with bob alone: bob gets its tables and its
     bucket; alice gets neither, and doesn't see it;
  4. deleting sales takes its access away, in every system: alice and bob
     lose its tables in Trino (Ranger) and its files in Buckets, the
     pipelines lose its landing/, and the project's Keycloak groups go. Its
     data stays;
  5. creating sales again gives it all back.
