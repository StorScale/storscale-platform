"""End-to-end checks for the Airflow example: docker compose run --rm test

People sign in through Keycloak's own login form, as in a browser, then use
Airflow's REST API with the token the sign-in gave them, as Airflow's UI does:

  1. Keycloak sign-in: bob (engineers) and alice (analysts) get in, with their
     groups as their Airflow roles (Op, Viewer); carol (no group) is refused;
  2. the roles mean what they say: alice can't trigger a pipeline, bob can;
  3. bob's run of sales_ingest succeeds, and its tasks ran as the pipelines'
     service account, not as bob: in Buckets (landing/ only, through STS) and
     in Trino, where Ranger applies, and audits, the pipelines group's policies;
  4. Airflow holds no S3 keys or Trino password: its one connection is the
     service account's Keycloak client.
